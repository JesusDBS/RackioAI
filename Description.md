Rackio Artificial Intelligence (RackioAI for short) is base on [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/),
[Keras](https://keras.io/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
mainly, and it was born to take advantage of the powerful advantage that [Rackio](https://rackio-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) offers as a web development framework 
for the automation and control industry.

As a Chemical engineer we were in face with the vast problem to create, train and deploy machine learning and deep
learning models with a long time for these steps development.

That is why this project was started, with the idea of ​​reducing the time gap in data analysis and development of 
machine learning models.

# Welcome to Rackio-AI Documentation

**RackioAI** is a [Rackio](https://github.com/rack-io/rackio-framework) extension for Artificial Intelligence (AI) models.

The project was started in 2020 by [Eng. Carlos Rivero](https://github.com/crivero7) as a *Leak Detection System* and *Virtual Analyzer*
project at [Intelcon System C.A](http://intelconsystem.com/) and [MCL Control S.A](http://mclcontrol.com/) respectively as a workaround to development and deployment 
*Deep Learning* models faster way.
 
Before lets talk about **RackioAI** is important to know the [Rackio](https://rackio-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
software intention because *RackioAI* was born to be implemented on the Rackio's 
system architecture to take advantage of this feature.

# Why RackioAI

Initially, Rackio Artificial Intelligence (RackioAI for short) is base on [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/),
[Keras](https://keras.io/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
mainly, and it was born to take advantage of the powerful advantage that rackio offers as a web development framework 
for the automation and control industry.

As a Chemical engineer we were in face with the vast problem to create, train and deploy machine learning and deep
learning models with a long time for these steps development.

That is why this project was started, with the idea of ​​reducing the time gap in data analysis and development of 
machine learning models.
